# MyReads Project

This project allows you to search a listing of books and add them onto your bookshelves.
You can 3 different kinds of bookshelves (Currently reading, Would like to Read, and Already Read).
You can add/remove books from your bookshelves by using the green '+' icon in the lower right hand corner of each book which will bring up a dropdown with options to add/remove the book.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install` (or `npm install` will also work)
* start the development server with `yarn start` (or `npm start` will also work)

## Backend Server

There is a provided backend server for the app to provide persistence (this is what allows bookshelves to be saved even with page refreshes).
The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods the app uses to add/remove books to the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
